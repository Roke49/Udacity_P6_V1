# Udacity_P6_V1
# Project 6 for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree
## Summary
The primary dataset for this project is the CDC Wonder dataset documenting extreme heat events,
county-by-county across the US, for the years 1981-2010.  What these data show is that there has
already been a major increase in the frequency of abnormally hot summer days in the US during
an interval in which the increase in global mean temperature is quite modest.  A secondary message
is that climate changes on a short scale can make it difficult to see the longer term trends, and
that the effects of climate change differ significantly across geographic regions.
