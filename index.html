  <h1>Climate Change And Extreme Heat Events In The US</h1>
  <div id="textContainer">
  <p>Understanding the potential impacts of climate change on
    human health is of key importance as the Earth continues to warm.
    One area of major concern is how much more morbidity and
    mortality we may see from severe heat stress.  If daily maximum
    temperatures simply increase by the amount that the Earth’s
    average temperature is rising, this impact would be relatively
    small.  On the other hand, if a warming climate brings
    many more severe heat waves, the risk for serious adverse
    impacts to human health is much higher.</p>
  <p>In 2015 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
    (“CDC”) released an analysis of what they called “heat wave days”
    in the U.S. for the years 1980-2010.  The data from this analysis
    are the subject of the visualization that follows.  The underlying
    data are the daily maximum and minimum air temperature, and a
    calculated heat stress index, for each county in the US for the
    months of May through September.  The definition of heat wave days was
    2 or more days in succession when the maximum air temperature
    (or heat stress index) exceeded the 95th percentile for that date in
    that county.  This visualization depicts the data based on maximum
    daily temperature.  Additionally,  data showing the change in global mean
    surface temperature of the Earth are portrayed</p>
